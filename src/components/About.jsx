            <p className="about">I'm Joel Roney, a junior developer with a background in business and software sales. I bring a unique perspective to development, combining technical skills with experience collaborating across departments and teams for the benefit of the whole organization. I'm driven by a passion for engineering efficiency and deepening my knowledge of the software landscape.</p>
            <p className="about">Iâ€™m rapidly expanding my expertise in full-stack development. My prior experience in business and software sales has given me social and team skills that drive value for users and companies alike. I have a particular fondness of databases and enjoy learning new tools and frameworks to keep pace with the evolving tech landscape. I focus on design patterns and am constantly looking for ways to program smarter. Outside of development, I enjoy exploring the world of music, and have a deep love for film.</p>
